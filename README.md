# My C & CPP Projects Portfolio

Here are some of the projects I have worked on, organized under my GitHub organization.

## [**HiveProjects**](https://github.com/hive-helsinki-projects)

HiveProjects is a collection of various projects developed during my time at Hive Helsinki, a coding school that follows the 42 Network curriculum. These projects cover a wide range of topics, including system programming, algorithmic challenges, web development, and more. Each project is designed to enhance my skills in different areas of software development.
